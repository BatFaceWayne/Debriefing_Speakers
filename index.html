            <strong>Background:</strong> Debriefings are central to effective learning in simulation-based medical education. However, educators often face challenges when conducting debriefings, which are further compounded by the lack of empirically derived knowledge on optimal debriefing processes. The goal of this study was to explore the technical feasibility of audio-based speaker diarization for automatically, objectively, and reliably measuring debriefing interaction patterns among debriefers and participants. Additionally, it aimed to investigate the ability to automatically create statistical analyses and visualizations, such as sociograms, solely from the audio recordings of debriefings among debriefers and participants.
            
            <strong>Methods:</strong> We used a microphone to record the audio of debriefings conducted during simulation-based team training with third-year medical students. The debriefings were led by two healthcare simulation instructors. We processed the recorded audio file using speaker diarization machine learning algorithms and validated the results manually to showcase its accuracy. We selected two debriefings to compare the speaker diarization results between different sessions, aiming to demonstrate similarities and differences in interaction patterns.
            
            <strong>Results:</strong> Ten debriefings were analyzed, each lasting about 30 minutes. After data processing, the recorded data enabled speaker diarization, which in turn facilitated the automatic creation of visualized interaction patterns, such as sociograms. The findings and data visualizations demonstrated the technical feasibility of implementing audiobased visualizations of interaction patterns, with an average accuracy of 97.78%.We further analyzed two different debriefing cases to uncover similarities and differences between the sessions. By quantifying the response rate from participants, we were able to determine and quantify the level of interaction patterns triggered by instructors in each debriefing session. In one session, the debriefers triggered 28% of the feedback from students, while in the other session, this percentage increased to 36%. Conclusion: Our results indicate that speaker diarization technology can be applied accurately and automatically to provide visualizations of debriefing interactions. This application can be beneficial for the development of simulation educator faculty. These visualizations can support instructors in facilitating and assessing debriefing sessions, ultimately enhancing learning outcomes in simulation-based healthcare education.

          Audio data was recorded using an off-the-shelf audio recorder during debriefing sessions conducted in a circular setting. Machine learning algorithms were applied to de-noise the raw audio data and to identify and track the same speakers across the whole session. The tracked speaker sequence was further manually assigned with respective identity (Debriefer/Student), which was then utilized to generate interaction pattern graphs, including bar charts and sociograms. The generated pattern graphs visually depict the interactions between speakers in a way that facilitates easy analysis of the respective debriefing sessions.

          Overview of the algorithmic toolkit output. Conversation flow bar charts (a) visually depict speaking sequence and timing, highlighting active contributors with debriefers (D) in red and medical students (S) in grey. Speaking distribution pie chart (b) illustrates the proportional distribution of speaking time between debriefers, students, and silence. Sociogram network graph (c) analyzes interaction patterns and turn-taking dynamics between instructors and participants, showcasing relationships and communication flows with thicker lines indicating longer durations.

         Manual semantic meaning overlay of debriefing stages of two speaker flow charts enables to perform stage-specific analysis. For example, in the discussion-centric stage A2, where students discuss and reflect on the hand-over simulation, recording 05 was dominated by student discussions whereas recording 02 showed longer feedback (F) sequences from debriefers. This suggests a more effective A2 stage in recording 05 in terms of students’ engagement.

         Backward association of students’ engagement in the discussion, focusing on what triggers their reflection and sharing. (a) shows the directional sociogram on backward-associating the students’ sharing for recording 02 and 05. The idea is further shown in (b). (c) shows the numeric comparison between two indicated recordings. In recording 02, 28% of feedback from students was triggered by debriefers, while in recording 05, it increased to 36%. Hence, we can conclude that in recording 05, the debriefers were more successful in promoting feedback and facilitating student sharing.
